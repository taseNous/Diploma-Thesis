# Thesis
The thesis focuses on the implementation of a pipelining simulation program
using the Python programming language. The user can manage the set of instructions, 
as well as values in the registers and the memory.

Hazards arise, due to dependencies between instructions (data or procedural), 
which can lead to execution delays. The user chooses a method to confront with these 
problems, such as NOP (No OPeration) instructions, pipeline freezing (pipeline stages 
lock), bypassing and branch prediction.
