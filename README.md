# Thesis
The thesis focuses on the implementation of a pipelining simulation program
using the Python programming language. The design of the simulator is presented, as
well as how it handles instructions, registers and memory. In addition, detailed
examples are provided showing how different techniques affect the execution of
instructions within the mechanism.

The hazards that can arise, due to dependencies between instructions (data or procedural), 
which can lead to execution delays, are also considered.

To address these problems, several techniques are presented, such as NOP (No
OPeration) instructions, pipeline freezing (pipeline stages lock), bypassing and branch
prediction.
